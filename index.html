    <!-- First informational paragraph: Overview --> 
	  <h2>Help Fight Injustice and Corruption</h2>
    <p>
      The Troubled Teen Industry (TTI) exploits vulnerable young people and their families. Its abusive practices must be abolished and these private youth programs must be reformed. Every year, over 50,000 teenagers are kept in treatment facilities against their will. The TTI is marketed towards parents with teens and proclaims that they can be “fixed” for problems ranging from low self-esteem to addiction, or simply being LGBTQ+. No LGBTQ+ teenager should be subject to conversion therapy and no teenager should be targeted and profited off of by the Troubled Teen Industry.
    </p> 

    <!-- Second informational paragraph: Impact --> 
	  <h2>Why the TTI Affects All of Us</h2>
    <p>
      A possible misconception is that the young victims of the TTI are unreliable sources or somehow deserve to be in their position. This is false- reasons teens are sent away range from low self-esteem or playing too many video games to being LGBTQ+ or being sexually assaulted. The TTI affects us all because teen rights are being suppressed and this is just one example of how youth rights are being violated. Families of teens are also negatively affected and coerced by this industry. It is important for all of us to unify to combat injustices like the TTI and many more to fight for the rights youth deserve!
